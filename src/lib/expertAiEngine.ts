Based on your profile details (**${activity}**, Cost: **${inr(cost)}**, Family Income: **${inr(income)}/yr**, Age: **${age} yrs** in **${district}, ${state}**), here are the exact official government schemes you are eligible for:

| Official Scheme | Max Ceiling | Concessional Interest | Grace Period | 90% Financed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. ${primaryScheme}** | **${primaryCap}** | **${primaryRate}** | **3–12 months** | **${inr(loan90)}** |
| **2. ${alt1}** | Up to ₹10–50 Lakhs | Standard Concessional | 3–6 months | Up to 85–90% |
| **3. ${alt2}** | Up to ₹1 Crore | Bank Base Rate | 6–18 months | Up to 75–90% |

#### 📋 Why this is your best match:
- **Zero Heavy Margin Burden**: You only need **10% margin money (${inr(margin10)})**, the government funds the remaining **90% (${inr(loan90)})**.
- **Interest Benefit**: Commercial loans charge 14%–18%; NSFDC concessional loans save you thousands in interest every year.
- **Moratorium Relief**: You do not have to pay principal EMIs during the initial setup period.

**Next Action**: Would you like me to show the **required document checklist** or locate the nearest **authorized low-NPA bank branch** in ${district}?`;

A **Moratorium (or Grace Period)** is a repayment holiday provided so you can set up your business or complete your studies without the burden of immediate EMI payments:

1. **Duration by Scheme**:
   - **Micro Finance Scheme**: **3 Months** grace.
   - **Term Loan Scheme**: **6 Months** grace.
   - **Educational Loan Scheme**: **Entire Course Duration + 6 Months** (or 1 year after getting employment).

2. **How Interest Works During Grace Period**:
   - You only pay **simple interest** during this period (or it gets accrued into principal).
   - Regular principal EMI deductions begin only **after** the moratorium ends.

💡 **Pro Tip**: Paying small simple interest monthly during the grace period prevents interest capitalization and significantly lowers your total lifetime repayment!`;

NSFDC does **not** disburse cash directly to citizens. All loans are sanctioned through institutional **Channel Partners**:

1. **Types of Channel Partners**:
   - **State Channelizing Agencies (SCAs)**: Dedicated state corporation (e.g. MP State SC Development Corp, MahaVitaran/Mahatmas Phule Corp).
   - **Public Sector Banks**: State Bank of India (SBI), Bank of India (BOI), Punjab National Bank (PNB), Canara Bank, Union Bank.
   - **Regional Rural Banks (RRBs)**: Local Gramin banks in rural/semi-urban districts.

2. **Why NPA Health Status Matters**:
   - 🟢 **Healthy (<5% NPA)**: Fast turnaround, active fund allocations, minimal bureaucratic delays.
   - 🟡 **Watchlist (5–10% NPA)**: Moderate processing speed.
   - 🔴 **High NPA (≥10%)**: Avoid if possible, as high bad debts choke fresh loan disbursements.

Regarding your query: *"**${lastUserMsg}**"*

Here are the key official guidelines under **${recName}**:

1. **Concessional Financing**: Government schemes finance up to **90% (${inr(loan90)})** of your total project requirement with only **10% margin money** required from you.
2. **Interest Subsidy**: Benefit from reducing-balance concessional rates (**6.5% – 8.0% p.a.**) which are significantly lower than private commercial loans.
3. **Application Channel**: Approach an authorized State Channelizing Agency (SCA) or nearest Public Sector Bank with your SC Caste Certificate, Income Certificate, and Detailed Project Report (DPR).

What specific aspect would you like to explore next? You can ask about **EMI calculations**, **required documents**, or **nearest bank branches**.`;
